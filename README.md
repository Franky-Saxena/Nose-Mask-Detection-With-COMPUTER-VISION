# Nose-Mask-Detection-With-COMPUTER-VISION

Through project we want to solve the problem of any of the organization. 

At the time of Covid-19 Government of India were doing mask compulsory. So aim to order's of GoI I just created the model which is very much capable of predicting that a person in wearing mask or not.

In this project we have the dataset with two directories in which there are two types of image one is of person's with mask and other is having person with no mask.

So in this project we just created the Architecture of the cnn with `2-CNN` layers and last `Dense` output layer.

This `CNN Model` is having the `94.38%` accuracy on test dataset.

## Modules used:
* os
* OPENCV
* numpy
* keras
    * models
        * Sequential
        * load_model
    * layers
        * Dense
        * Activation
        * Flatten
        * Dropout
    * callbacks
        * ModelCheckpoint
* scikit-learn
    * train_test_split
* matplotlib

## To check a person is wearing mask or not
run a following command in command prompt
```
jupyter notebook(in the main directory)
```
## Deployment
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
6. Construct the Architecture of the Neural Network
7. Tuning the model
8. Predicting the person is wearing mask or not.
9. Pushing code to Github
```
